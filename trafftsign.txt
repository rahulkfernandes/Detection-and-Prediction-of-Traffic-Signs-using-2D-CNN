Problem Statement: To train a model to detect traffic signs in real time using deep learning.
This study proposes a traffic signs detection system based on 2D Deep Convolution Network model using a dataset of images of traffic signs. 
The images are pre-processed by first converting the images to gray scale and then equalized and normalized. 
The CNN model consists of 4 layers of convolution for feature extraction and 1 layer of fully connected network with 500 neurons, with activation function Relu and 1 layer of fully connected dense layer with activation function softmax for classification.
The data set is split up as X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test with testsize as 0.2 for training the model.
